What are the main components in Machine Learning?**\n","\n","   Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Main components are: Data, Model, Algorithm, Loss Function, Optimizer.\n","\n","5. **How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?**\n","\n","   A low loss value indicates that the model’s predictions are close to the actual values, hence better performance.\n","\n","6. **What are continuous and categorical variables?**\n","   \n","   Continuous variables are numeric values with an infinite range (e.g., height). Categorical variables represent categories or labels (e.g., gender).\n","\n","7. **How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?**\n","  \n","  Common techniques include Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding using libraries like `sklearn.preprocessing`.\n","\n","8. **What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?**\n","\n","   Training data is used to train the model, while testing data is used to evaluate the model’s performance.\n","\n","9. **What is sklearn.preprocessing?**\n","   \n","   It is a module in scikit-learn providing functions for data preprocessing like scaling, encoding, and normalization.\n","\n","10. **What is a Test set?**\n","   \n","    A test set is a subset of the dataset used to assess the performance of a trained model.\n","\n","11.\n"," **How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?**\n","    Using `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection`:\n","\n","```python\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n","```\n","\n","12. **How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?**\n","    \n","    Steps: Define problem, gather data, preprocess data, select model, train model, evaluate, and tune hyperparameters.\n","\n","13. **Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?**\n","    \n","    Exploratory Data Analysis helps understand the data structure, detect outliers, and choose appropriate preprocessing techniques.\n","\n","14. **What is correlation?**\n","   \n","    Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables\n","\n","15. **What does negative correlation mean?**\n","    \n","    Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease\n","\n","16. **How can you find correlation between variables in Python?**\n","   \n","    Using pandas:\n","\n","```python\n","df.corr()\n","```\n","\n","17. **What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.**\n","\n","    Causation implies one variable directly affects another. Correlation only shows a relationship. Example: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths are correlated (due to summer) but one doesn’t cause the other.\n","\n","18. **What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.**\n","\n","    Optimizers update model parameters to minimize loss. Types:\n","\n","* SGD: Stochastic Gradient Descent\n","* Adam: Adaptive Moment Estimation\n","* RMSprop: Root Mean Square Propagation\n","  Example in TensorFlow:\n","\n","```python\n","optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()\n","```\n","\n","19. **What is sklearn.linear\\_model?**\n","\n","    It is a module in scikit-learn for linear models like LinearRegression, LogisticRegression.\n","\n","20. **What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?**\n","\n","    `model.fit()` trains the model. Requires features (X) and target (y):\n","\n","```python\n","model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","```\n","\n","21. **What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?**\n","\n","    `model.predict()` makes predictions on new data:\n","\n","```python\n","predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n","```\n","\n","22. **What are continuous and categorical variables?**\n","\n","    (Repeated) Already answered in Q6.\n","\n","23. **What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?**\n","   \n","    Feature scaling normalizes data within a range. It helps algorithms like SVM and k-NN perform better by treating all features equally.\n","\n","24. **How do we perform scaling in Python?**\n","   \n","    Using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`:\n","\n","```python\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","scaler = StandardScaler()\n","X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n","```\n","\n","25. **Explain data encoding.**\n","   \n","    Data encoding converts categorical data into numeric form.
